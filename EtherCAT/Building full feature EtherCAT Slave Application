对于TI给的ethercat_slave_full_AM437x_arm,学习step
1.找到.bat 执行./bat argus AM437x arm ethercat_slave_full
其中修改.bat中set的路径可能会出现error，可以解决，大部分都是路径，version
2.生成的ethercat_slave_full_AM437x_arm project
其中debug时会出现error
Building full feature EtherCAT Slave Application
 The EtherCAT example application provided in [INSTALL-DIR]/examples/ethercat_slave folder is a limited development 

application. To have a full development capability on Sitara processor, it
is necessary to get the EtherCAT Slave Stack Code (SSC) from Beckhoff and build this for Sitara processors. Ethercat full 

mode example application provides all board specific
implementation sources for EtherCAT and a patch file to modify Beckhoff source files for Sitara processors. This 

application can be found in [INSTALL-DIR]/protocols/ethercat_slave/ecat_appl.
This folder also includes the configuration xml file to be used for testing and it can be found in[INSTALL-

DIR]/protocols/ethercat_slave/ecat_appl/esi folder.
 The steps for building full feature EtherCAT application using Beckhoff stack source code are given below.

1. Download EtherCAT stack version 5.11 from ETG website (http://www.ethercat.org/) and extract it to a local folder.
下载倍福的ssc5.11源码，打补丁到src
2. Apply ( See Apply instructions below) TI_ECAT.patch file found at [INSTALL-

DIR]/third_party/protocols/ethercat_slave/patch on extracted Beckhoff stack code.
   （Applying a Patch file
Download Windows Patch Utility from gnuwin32 sourceforge (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/patch-bin-zip.php). ( 

Note that this is not a TI tool - See licensing information
(http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/patch/) page for more details)
Download Dos2Unix/Unix2Dos-Text file format converters from gnuwin32 sourceforge 

(https://sourceforge.net/projects/dos2unix/). ( Note that this is not a TI tool - See licensing
information (http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/patch/) page for more details)
Extract the zip files to the Windows PC. Patch file utility(Patch.exe) and unix2dos.exe utility can be found in their bin 

folders.
Launch DOS Command prompt ( Start->Run->cmd).
CD to the folder [INSTALL-DIR]/third_party/protocols/ethercat_slave/patch which contains TI_ECAT.patch.
Execute unix2dos.exe as given below
[Dos2Unix/Unix2Dos-DIR]/bin/unix2dos.exe TI_ECAT.patch
CD to patch file utility bin folder.
Execute patch.exe as given below
patch.exe -i PATCH_FILE_NAME -d SOURCE_DIR
where PATCH_FILE is name of the patch file with full path and
SOURCE_DIR is Directory with full path where source files are present.
Example :
patch.exe -i [INSTALL-DIR]/third_party/protocols/ethercat_slave/patch/TI_ECAT.patch -d c:\SSC_V5i11\SlaveFiles\src）
这一步是下载 Windows Patch Utility from gnuwin32 sourceforge
到TI.ECAT.patch 执行 [Dos2Unix/Unix2Dos-DIR]/bin/unix2dos.exe TI_ECAT.patch
接下来到 patch.exe 所在目录执行  patch.exe -i PATCH_FILE_NAME -d SOURCE_DIR
patch success 可能会出现 hunks failed ,这时候重新回到上一步
3. Copy the patched Beckhoff source files (.c and .h) to [INSTALL-DIR]/protocols/ethercat_slave/ecat_appl/EcatStack
全部复制
4. Generate CCS project following [Steps_to_generate_Project_files 

(http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/PRU_ICSS_EtherCAT#Steps_to_generate_Project_files)]
执行 ./bat 
5. Launch CCS and import ethercat_slave_full application project found at the Project create directory (say, [INSTALL-

DIR]/protocols/ethercat_slave/projects) to CCS
6. Define macros in ecat_appl\EcatStack\ecat_def.h as required for your application.
1. Ensure that TIESC_HW is set to 1
2. For running default application, set TIESC_APPLICATION to 1 and CiA402_DEVICE to 0
3. For running CiA402 application, set TIESC_APPLICATION to 0 and CiA402_DEVICE to 1.
7. Build the project. This will generate the application binary which can be used to run on Sitara processors.
