The Programmable Real-Time Unit Subsystem and Industrial Communication Subsystem (PRU-ICSS)
consists of dual 32-bit RISC cores (Programmable Real-Time Units, or PRUs), shared, data, and
instruction memories, internal peripheral modules, and an interrupt controller (INTC). The programmable
nature of the PRU-ICSS, along with their access to pins, events and all SoC resources, provides flexibility
in implementing fast real-time responses, specialized data handling operations, custom peripheral
interfaces, and in offloading tasks from the other processor cores of the system-on-chip (SoC).
This device contains two subsystems: PRU-ICSS1 and PRU-ICSS0. PRU-ICSS1 is considered a superset
of PRU-ICSS0. Figure 30-1 details PRU-ICSS1 and PRU-ICSS0.
The PRU cores within the subsystems have access to all resources on the SoC through the Interface/OCP
Master port, and the external host processors can access the PRU-ICSS resources through the
Interface/OCP Slave port. The 32-bit interconnect bus connects the various internal and external masters
to the resources inside the PRU-ICSS. The INTC handles system input events and posts events back to
the device-level host CPU.
The PRU cores are programmed with a small, deterministic instruction set. Each PRU can operate
independently or in coordination with each other and can also work in coordination with the device-level
host CPU. This interaction between processors is determined by the nature of the firmware loaded into the
PRU's instruction memories.
