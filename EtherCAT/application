EtherCAT
NOTE 1: SDK Supports two different versions of EtherCAT application.
1 . Simple Demo Application - An EtherCAT sample application built using pre-built EtherCAT stack library
(libecat_slave_stack_am437x.a). This allows limited development using SSC5.10 stack library via Sample
Application Interface which provides controlling 32- bit input and 32-bit output. Object dictionary adaptation is not
possible in this evaluation version. This will be the default configuration for EtherCAT. The project files for this
application can be found in $(IA_SDK_HOME)\examples\ethercat_slave. The example application will be delivered
in source, but the EtherCAT stack will be delivered in object format only.
2. Full Feature Demo Application - This is a full-fledged application and provides full flexibility and
configurability. However this application need access to complete stack source. As per the SLA terms, TI cannot
distribute the stack (Beckhoff Slave Sample Code) in source format. Therefore, to build this application, user must
get the SSC 5.10 source code from ETG website and apply the provided patch. The project files for this application
can be found in $(IA_SDK_HOME)\protocols\ethercat_slave\ecat_appl. Please see the details in later sections. For
more information, refer the section on "Building Full Feature EtherCAT Application" of this document. This
application includes motor control functionality
