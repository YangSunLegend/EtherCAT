GCC
Setting Up The Tool Chain
Make system configuration:
1. The make system needs to be configured for the build environment.
2. The Rules.make file at the root folder of the StarterWare installation contains the build environment used by the
make system.
3. The build variables in Rules.make need to be setup to point to the correct installation paths, depending on
whether it is a Windows or Linux based build.
4. KW_PATH in Rules.make stands for klocwork (static code checker) installation. This does not need to be
specified if KW_BUILD is set as 'no' in Rules.make (default).
Windows/Cygwin Linaro arm-none-eabi (command line):
1. If a Windows host is used, then Cygwin needs to be installed for gcc build.
2. Application makefiles invoke library makefiles internally.
3. "set CYGPATH=cygpath" to convert Windows native style filenames to POSIX style file names. Not doing this
might lead to linker errors while trying to find libc path.
4. Ensure that the Linaro installation path does not contain any white space
5. cygwin from the CCSv6 installation can be used. gmake from the xdc installation can be used.
1. gmake is available at: <XDC installation dir>
2. cygwin is available at: <CCS installation dir>/ccsv6/utils/cygwin
6. Update (if required) the following GCC_PATH build environment variable to point to the correct installation
paths.
